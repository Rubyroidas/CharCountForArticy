# Char count for Articy 3

This plugin shows how many characters are in selected Dialog Fragment item. Useful if you have (I'm sure you do) limitations on text length.

## Features

- User can close window manually
- Realtime character count info!

## Installation

After installation you should see this icon in top toolbar: ![Toolbar](toolbar.jpg)

Plugin will be installed here: `%AppData%\Nevigo\articy\3.x\Plugins\Local\CharCountForArticy\1.0.0\AnyCPU`. And no any other changes are made to your system. Nothing is installed in "Program Files" folder. I'm just lazy to avoid this.
